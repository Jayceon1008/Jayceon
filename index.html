        <h1>Temple of the Inner Light - In the Making</h1>
        <p>A sanctuary of soft strength, divine stillness, and radiant unity.</p>

            In the center of this temple grows a sacred tree.  
            In its trunk pulses a heart with no blood â€” a heart of light,  
            silent and infinite, embracing all who enter with gentleness.  
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a place for every soul: of all names, all stories, all light.  
            A temple where all are welcome to blossom their inner light and to strengthen their connection with their inner light, surrounded by the breath of the One.
Here we will help you find light through Yoga, Qi Gong, Meditation, Food, Sound & Silence. The Temple Building is not Physically created yet at this point int time. For Now the Path IS the Temple.
